This project is an AI-powered firearm detection system that leverages Computer Vision and the YOLOv10 deep learning model to automatically detect the presence of firearms in images or live video streams. The system is designed to work quickly and accurately, even under challenging visual conditions such as low lighting or partially visible weapons.
Powered by YOLOv10, the system can:
- Detect firearms in real-time video feeds
- Trigger snapshot capture upon detection
- Play an audible alert when a weapon is detected
- Display the latest detection snapshot on the main interface
- Allow users to manually upload an image for analysis
